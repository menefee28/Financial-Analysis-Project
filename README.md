# Financial-Analysis-Project
This project is a three-page financial analysis dashboard built in Excel using PivotTables, Power Query, and the Data Model. It consolidates program cost data, material purchasing data, and labor hours into a structured reporting system designed to support executive-level financial analysis.
Project Overview

The dashboards analyze financial performance, procurement activity, and labor allocation. All metrics and visuals are generated using linked PivotTables, relationships, and structured data modeling. The objective is to transform raw operational data into clear, interpretable insights for decision-making.
